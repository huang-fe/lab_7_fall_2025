        TODO: Paste your Lab 6 implementation and extend it for tracking commands.

        HINTS:
        - The parsing logic will depend on exactly how you format your GPT model/system prompt!
        - The commands you define here will be used to execute the commands in the execute_command function, which you'll also implement below.
        - Think carefully about the sequential structure of the LLM's output and how your system prompt tells the model to format commands.
        - For example, if your prompt instructs GPT to output one command per line, you should parse only a single command from each line.
        - You may need to match/substitute multiple possible phrasings (e.g. "move forward", "walk forward") to a canonical command like "move".
        
        NEW FOR LAB 7 - Tracking Commands:
        - Add detection for "start tracking [object]" or "track the [object]" or "follow the [object]"
        - Extract the object name (e.g., "person", "dog", "cat") from the phrase
        - Return a command like "track_person" or "track_dog" (format: "track_{object_name}")
        - Add detection for "stop tracking" or "stop following" → return "stop_tracking"
        
        Example tracking command parsing:
            line = "Start tracking person"
            → extract "person" and return ["track_person"]
            
            line = "Follow the dog"
            → extract "dog" and return ["track_dog"]
            
            line = "Stop tracking"
            → return ["stop_tracking"]
        
        - Construct and return a list of action strings (e.g. ['move', 'turn_left']) extracted from the line.
        - Test your command extraction logic carefully, since if the output is not sequential, your robot may behave out of order!

        Example:
            line = "Move forward"
            returns ['move']

            line = "<move, turn_left>"
